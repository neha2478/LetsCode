Here we will keep a note for Python ....

"""  print() function how 
# print(" Shruti ")
# print(" Jagan ")

# print(my_var:= "Hello World!")

# my_var1 = "Yes"
# print(my_var1)

# print(my_var2 := "Hello Kundan and Nilesh!!")

"""  How to define the Function in Pytho  we use def keyword """
# def foo():

# The above is an empty function...


a = 1
print('Hello World!', a)
#here we are passing a variable as a an argument ......

b = 12
print('Hello Shruti' , b)




#For Loop :- To iterate on each elememt in Python

The end keyword
The keyword argument end can be used to avoid the newline after the output, or end the output with a different string:

phrase = ['printed' , 'with' , 'a', 'dash' , 'in', 'between']

print("The words in the Phrase :")
# here i is the index for the for Loop we took 

for i in phrase:
        print( i , end= ' , ')
"""
    sep - this keyword is to specify how to seperate the objects, if there is more than one:
print('Shruti', 'Kundan' , 'Nilesh' , sep = ' , ')

greeting = 'Hello'
greeting += ' World! '

print(greeting)

number = 1
number += 5
print(number)

my_list = ['item']
my_list *= 3
print(my_list)

#input()   -   This function takes the input from the user and converts it into a string:

`input() can also set a default message without using print():` print()
>>> my_name = input('Where is your name? ')
>>> print('Hi, {}'.format(my_name))

It is also possible to use formatted strings to avoid using .format:

print('What is your name?')
my_name = input()
print('Hi, {}' .format(my_name))
#another way to do so is...
print(f'Hi , {my_name}')



The len() Function :- 
Evaluates to the integer value of the number of characters in a string, list, dictionary, etc.:

>>> len('hello')
#5


a = 'hello'
print(len(a))

print(len(['cat', 3 , 'dog'])) # here we can pass the List in the len() any datatype of Function


#Errors that I'm Facing.....
1> Causes of SyntaxError: invalid syntax, Missing a colon ( : ) at the end of a line or mixing up other symbols. 
Missing a colon ( : ) at the end of a line or mixing up other symbols.

What does an indent look like?
In a composition, an indentation is a blank space between a margin and the beginning of a line of text. The beginning of this paragraph is indented. Standard paragraph
indentation is about five spaces or one-quarter to one-half of an inch, depending on which style guide you follow.

2> The Unexpected Indent Error is a common syntax error in Python that occurs when the interpreter encounters an indentation that it does not expect.



# print(len(['cat', 3 , 'dog'])) # here we can pass the List in the len() any datatype of Function


# a = ['Shruti', 'Neha', 'Jojo', 'Rehman']
# b = input() 
# if len(a) > 0:
#     print("the list is not empty")

# elif a[i] != b:
#     print("Not Found")
    
# elif a[i] == b:
#     print("It's there", a)

# else :
#     print("Come out!!")
    
    #Example :
    
# x = 200
# if x > 15:
#     print("x is greater than 15")
# elif x > 10:
#     print("x is greater than 10")
# elif x > 5:
#     print("x is greater than 5")


#The functions ofdatatype:-
"""
These are the built in datatypes
numeric  types - [ int() , float() , complex() , str() , boolean()]
Collection types  - [list, tuple, dict , set]
"""
print(str(35)) # first it will convert the 35 in string than print() it  will print that .....

print(bool(26))
print(int('11'))
print(float('3.14'))


#### CONCATENATION OF STRINGS IN PYTHON
a = 'Alice'
c = a + ' Shruti'
print(c)

print('Alice' +  ' Shraddha')

print('Alice ' * 8) #Alice Alice Alice Alice Alice Alice Alice Alice

print('Alice ' ' Bob') #Alice Bob


Python Built-in Functions :-
The Python interpreter has a number of functions and types built into it that are always available.
1> abs()        -      	Return the absolute value of a number. 
        
        #integer Number
        a = -45
        print('Absolute value of integer is:' , abs(a)) #Absolute value of integer is: 45
        
        #floating Number
        b = -54.56
        print('Absolute value of integer is:' , abs(b)) #Absolute value of integer is: 54.56
        
        #A complex Number
        c = (5 + 6j)
        d = (7 - 6j)
        print('Absolute value of integer is:', abs(c)) #Absolute value of integer is: 7.810249675906654
        print('Absolute value of integer is:', "c = ", abs(c), "," ,"d = " , abs(d))  #Absolute value of integer is: c =  7.810249675906654 , d =  9.219544457292887


2> aiter()      -          Return an asynchronous iterator for an asynchronous iterable.
