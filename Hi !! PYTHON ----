Here we will keep a note for Python ....

"""  print() function how 
# print(" Shruti ")
# print(" Jagan ")

# print(my_var:= "Hello World!")

# my_var1 = "Yes"
# print(my_var1)

# print(my_var2 := "Hello Kundan and Nilesh!!")

"""  How to define the Function in Pytho  we use def keyword """
# def foo():

# The above is an empty function...


a = 1
print('Hello World!', a)
#here we are passing a variable as a an argument ......

b = 12
print('Hello Shruti' , b)



#For Loop :- To iterate on each elememt in Python

The end keyword
The keyword argument end can be used to avoid the newline after the output, or end the output with a different string:

phrase = ['printed' , 'with' , 'a', 'dash' , 'in', 'between']

print("The words in the Phrase :")
# here i is the index for the for Loop we took 

for i in phrase:
        print( i , end= ' , ')
"""
    sep - this keyword is to specify how to seperate the objects, if there is more than one:
print('Shruti', 'Kundan' , 'Nilesh' , sep = ' , ')

greeting = 'Hello'
greeting += ' World! '

print(greeting)

number = 1
number += 5
print(number)

my_list = ['item']
my_list *= 3
print(my_list)

#input()   -   This function takes the input from the user and converts it into a string:

`input() can also set a default message without using print():` print()
>>> my_name = input('Where is your name? ')
>>> print('Hi, {}'.format(my_name))

It is also possible to use formatted strings to avoid using .format:

print('What is your name?')
my_name = input()
print('Hi, {}' .format(my_name))
#another way to do so is...
print(f'Hi , {my_name}')



The len() Function :- 
Evaluates to the integer value of the number of characters in a string, list, dictionary, etc.:

>>> len('hello')
#5


a = 'hello'
print(len(a))

print(len(['cat', 3 , 'dog'])) # here we can pass the List in the len() any datatype of Function


#Errors that I'm Facing.....
1> Causes of SyntaxError: invalid syntax, Missing a colon ( : ) at the end of a line or mixing up other symbols. 
Missing a colon ( : ) at the end of a line or mixing up other symbols.

What does an indent look like?
In a composition, an indentation is a blank space between a margin and the beginning of a line of text. The beginning of this paragraph is indented. Standard paragraph
indentation is about five spaces or one-quarter to one-half of an inch, depending on which style guide you follow.

2> The Unexpected Indent Error is a common syntax error in Python that occurs when the interpreter encounters an indentation that it does not expect.
